# Order numbers

# Description

The goal of this project is to develop a Java program that allows users to enter a list of numbers and sort
it in ascending or descending order, depending on their choice. The program must be able to handle different 
quantities of numbers and ensure an efficient and accurate sorting process.

# How It Works
Input Number of Elements:

The program first prompts the user to enter the number of elements they wish to input.
Enter Numbers:

The user is then asked to input the numbers one by one.
The number 4 is not accepted. If the user inputs 4, the program will ask them to enter another number.
Choose Sorting Order:

After all numbers are entered, the program asks the user to specify the sorting order:
Enter 'A' for ascending order.
Enter 'D' for descending order.
The program will sort the numbers accordingly.
Display Sorted Numbers:

The sorted list of numbers is then displayed based on the chosen order.
